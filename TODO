- #1 Look at arithmetic series solution
- #2 Look at how to access every nth element in a sequence. Since every 3rd
  number in the fibonacci sequence is even, we can just walk the sequence,
  skipping to every 3rd number.
- #2 There is a "closed form" for computing the fibonacci number. this could be
  faster than recursion, and may work nicely with walking a list of every 3rd
  number.
- #3 Restrict the trial factors to the list of prime numbers
